# battlesim: Modelling and animating simulated battles between units on the Web.

This project provides a Totally Accurate Battle Simulator (TABS)-lite animation 
on a delivered web site with primitive forms of animation. We map 'units' onto 
a 2D plane get them to fight it out. Rounds finish when one team has completely
wiped out the other side, or reached a maximum time limit.

Users familiar with [Totally Accurate Battle Simulator](https://steamcommunity.com/app/508440)
 will hopefully love this package as a lot of the basic ideas are 
 derived from this.
 
See my [other project](https://github.com/gregparkes/BattleSimulator) 
for a Python implementation of this simulator, complete with examples, Jupyter notebooks,
teaching material, and more.

**Current version: 0.1**
